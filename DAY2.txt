Window Object


The Window object is a global object in client-side JavaScript, 
Representing the browser window containing a DOM document and acting as the root of the document object model.
The window object, supported by all browsers, 
Represents the browser’s window and automatically includes global JavaScript objects, functions, and variables as members.

Methods

window.open() - open a new window

window.close() - close the current window

window.moveTo() - move the current window

window.resizeTo() - resize the current window

Document Object

The Document object is the HTML document that appears in the browser window and serves as an interface for interacting with the web page’s content. 
The browser generates a Document Object Model of a web page upon loading it.
DOM is a logical tree in a document, with methods allowing programmatic access to change its structure, style, or content.


Methods

document.createElement(element)

document.removeChild(element)

Conclusion

Understanding the differences between Window and Document objects is crucial in JavaScript and web development.
Window manages browser interactions, while Document acts as an interface for content manipulation.
Using these functionalities allows developers to create interactive web experiences.
